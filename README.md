# Hello-World

My name is Eric Smith

Learning tool
I'm typing on line 6, this will be the first deviation I've made to the master file.
I've done data work in Tableau and (of course) Excel, but not a lot in R.
I used to work as a black belt before the era of big data, and I'd like to build my technical skills.

I work at Fiserv, a financial services provider of bank operationg platforms and applications. I work in Procurement as a Spend Analytics manager (although that is a manager of 1). Fiserv is very immmature in this area and too cheap to buy a third party application which would probably be more productive in the long run, however I have enjoyed building a spend analytics capability for the enterprise.
