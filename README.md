# Hello-World

My name is Eric Smith

Learning tool
I'm typing on line 6, this will be the first deviation I've made to the master file.
I've done data work in Tableau and (of course) Excel, but not a lot in R.
I used to work as a black belt before the era of big data, and I'd like to build my technical skills.
